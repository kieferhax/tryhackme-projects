## What is a Security Engineer
### Why Do Organizations Need Security?
As the internet age transform how organizations work worldwide, it also brings challenges.  While there is no doubt that technology has made the life of organizations a lot easier by opening new avenues of collaboration and innovation, we often hear about organizations getting hacked, losing customer data, getting ransomed, and facing other types of cyber attacks.

In responding to these threats, organizations can either go back to the old ways of doing business without getting any aid from modern technology, putting them at a disadvantage, or they can move forward and ensure that security of the digital side of their business.  

Hence, just like any organization will protect its physical assets and dedicate whole departments to them, a company's digital assets must also be secured.  It must be noted here that organizations do all of this to ensure their primary goal is achieved without hinderance.

### The Role of a Security Engineer
Keeping in view the above-mentioned need for security, organizations hire security engineers. In order to hire a security engineer, an organization perceives a security engineer as someone who:

- Owns the overall security of an organization. The main person responsible for securing an organization's digital assets.
- Ensures that the organization's cyber security risk is minimized at all times.
- Devises strategies and creates systems that minimize the risk posed by cyber security threats to an organization, identifies weak points, and prepares mitigation.
- Develops and implements secure network solutions
- Architects and engineers trustworthy, reliable, and secure systems.
- Collaborates and coordinates with other teams to establish security protocols across the organization.

### Qualification Required for a Security Engineer
As you might have noticed, the security engineer role mentioned above is very broad and might require a whole department instead of a single person. This is because this role is defined loosely and varies from organization to organization. An engineer takes large problems, breaks them down into smaller chunks, and then solves them. Therefore a security engineer is someone that follows this process for security problems. Meaning that even though you might have a job description, each day might be quite different since you are faced with various problems. Overall, when hiring a security engineer, organizations look for the following basic requirements:

- 0-2 years of experience with IT administration, helpdesk, networks, or security operations.
- Basic understanding of computer networks, operating systems, and programming.
- Basic understanding of security concepts such as Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

### Question 1
**Who ensures that an organization's cyber security risk is minimized at all times?**
*Answer:* Security Engineer

## Core Responsibilities of a Security Engineer
In the previous task, we established that a security engineer is responsible for an organization's security posture. In this task, we will expand on the general expectations that an organization has from a security engineer in order to help them achieve their goals in this role. Although loosely defined, security engineers will often be responsible for the areas that follow.

### Asset Management/Asset Inventory
One of the primary steps in ensuring an organization's security is to maintain an organization's asset inventory. In terms of cyber security, this will mean managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets. Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets teh organization has. 

They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP address, physical location, place in the network, applications running on the asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.

### Security Policies
An organization needs robust security policies to maintain a sound security posture. A security engineer helps the organization create security policies based on established Security Principles. These policies are then implemented organization-wide, and the security engineer ensures that the implementation follows the letter and spirit of the policies.

Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs. In such scenarios, the security engineer consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks. 

### Secure by Design
A security engineer ensures that the organization is secure by design. The engineer understands that the security posture receives the most Return on Investment (ROI) if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy. This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a Secure Network Architecture, ensures the organization's Windows, Linux, and Active Directory are hardened, and software development follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

### Security Assessment and Assurance
While securely designing the organization's network and infrastructure might be an excellent first step, a security engineer understands that their job is far from done after that. They understand that security is hard work that requires continuous effort. While a security engineer must ensure everything is done correctly, a compromise requires just one loophole to be successful. 

To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture. While security engineers might not be performing assessments and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activities, creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) for external parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.

### Question 2
**Where are details about an organization's digital assets, such as name, IP address, and owner, stored?**
*Answer:* Asset Inventory

### Question 3
**Sometimes security policies can't be followed because of business needs. What avenue does a security engineer have to fulfil business needs in these cases?**
*Answer:* Exceptions

### Question 4
**What philosophy, if followed, provides the most Return on Investment (ROI)?**
*Answer:* Secure by Design

## Continuous Improvement
An organization's security is not a one-time job but a continuous effort. Similarly, the security engineer's job doesn't end once policies are designed and implemented. Rather, it is a journey towards continuous improvement. The following steps help a security engineer carry out this role.

### Ensuring Awareness


### Managing Risk


### Change Management
